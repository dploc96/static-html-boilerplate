# Static HTML Webpack Boilerplate


Enjoy hand-writing your HTML? Keep it old-school with modern build tools. This boilerplate setup makes it easier to write your own styling, scripts, and mark-up.

## âœ¨ Features

- Write SCSS and modern JavaScript code in `src` and build minified, transpiled code for production in `dist`
- ES6+ to ES5 transpilation, bundling, and minification
- SCSS to CSS transpilation, bundling, autoprefixing, and minification
- Linting for HTML, Styles and Scripts by cmd and precommit
- Live reloading with webpack-dev-server
- Automatic copying of HTML and static assets from `src` to `dist` folders

## ðŸ›  Usage

- Write all your ES2015+ Javascript code in `src/js` and SCSS styling in `src/style`. Store static assets in `src/static`. Organize HTML files the way you like.
- Available commands:
  - `npm run serve`: Run `webpack-dev-server` at `localhost:9000`. Includes live reloading on any Javascript/SCSS/HTML changes.
  - `npm run start`: Builds files and runs a local production server on `localhost:8080` with `http-server`.
  - `npm run build`: Build files to the `dist` folder. Transpiles down to ES5 and bundles all JS into `app.bundle.js`. Transpiles SCSS to CSS and adds prefixing into `style.bundle.css`. Copies static assets and HTML over, and bundled CSS and JS gets added to HTML file.
  - `npm run run lint:js`: Lints JS with ESLint.
  - `npm run lint:styles`: Lints SCSS stylesheets with stylelint.
  - `npm run lint:html`: Lints HTML with HTMLhint.
  - `npm run lint` : Lints all
